# Python Bootcamp Journal
## Week 1

---

### Day 1
- 🥋 Katas:
  - `is_even` → Status: [✅]
  - `find_max` (with error handling) → Status: [✅]
  - `reverse_string` → Status: [✅]
  - `fizzbuzz` → Status: [✅]
- 🛠️ Project: Directory Scanner CLI → Status: [ ]
- 📝 Notes:
  - What went well?  
    Learnt about `isinstance`, refresh on types and loops in Python, and creating a test harness.  
    I think the test harness can be written to be more efficient as there is repetitive code.  
  - Where did you get stuck?  
    Just some syntax checks with `for` loops and using `range` in loops.  
  - What did you learn?  
    Refreshed fundamentals, type checking, and defensive programming with exceptions.

### Day 2
- 🥋 Katas:
  - `count_vowels` → Status: [✅]
  - `unique_elements` (list[int] type checking) → Status: [✅]
  - `factorial` (recursive with validation) → Status: [✅]
- 🛠️ Project: Directory Scanner CLI → Status: [ ]
- 📝 Notes:
  - What went well?  
    Practiced building lists and checking membership with sets.  
  - Where did you get stuck?  
    Handling type checks for `list[int]` needed some clarification.  
  - What did you learn?  
    How to raise `TypeError`/`ValueError` properly and build recursive solutions.

### Day 3
- 🥋 Katas:
  - `is_palindrome` → Status: [✅]
  - `factorial` (improved recursion) → Status: [✅]
- 🛠️ Project: Directory Scanner CLI → Status: [ ]
- 📝 Notes:
  - What went well?  
    Refactored solutions and understood recursive base cases more deeply.  
  - Where did you get stuck?  
    Accidentally overwrote variables (like using `.islower()` incorrectly). Fixed after debugging.  
  - What did you learn?  
    Cleaner string manipulation (`.lower()`, `.split()`, `[::-1]` slicing).

### Day 4
- 🥋 Katas:
  - Practice with dictionaries and error handling → Status: [✅]
- 🛠️ Project: Directory Scanner CLI → Status: [ ]
- 📝 Notes:
  - What went well?  
    Got more comfortable looping through dictionaries and handling edge cases.  
  - Where did you get stuck?  
    Needed some hints when looping across two dictionaries.  
  - What did you learn?  
    More practice with merging logic, keys, and values.

### Day 5
- 🥋 Katas:
  - `is_anagram` → Status: [✅]
  - `char_frequency` → Status: [✅]
  - `longest_word` → Status: [✅]
- 🛠️ Project: Directory Scanner CLI → Status: [ ]
- 📝 Notes:
  - What went well?  
    Finished all string parsing challenges.  
  - Where did you get stuck?  
    None — straightforward once broken down step by step.  
  - What did you learn?  
    Sorting strings, counting characters, and using `max(..., key=len)`.

### Day 6
- 🥋 Katas:
  - `word_count` (with regex to strip punctuation) → Status: [✅]
  - `most_common_word` (handling ties & empty strings) → Status: [✅]
  - `merge_dicts` (sum values of common keys) → Status: [✅]
- 🛠️ Project: Directory Scanner CLI → Status: [ ]
- 📝 Notes:
  - What went well?  
    Strong progress on text manipulation and dictionary merging. All tests passed.  
  - Where did you get stuck?  
    Handling the edge case of empty strings in `most_common_word` caused a crash, but fixed it by returning `""`.  
  - What did you learn?  
    Regex (`re.sub`) for cleaning text, dictionary merging strategies, and defensive coding.
