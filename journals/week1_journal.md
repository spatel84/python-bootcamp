# Python Bootcamp Journal
## Week 1

- 🛠️ Project: Directory Scanner CLI → Status: [ ]
- 📝 Notes (your reflections):
  - What went well? 
  learnt about isinstance, referesh on types and loops in python and creating a test harness. I think the test harness can be written to be more efficient as there is a repeative code.
  - Where did you get stuck? Just some syntax checks with using some of the python functions like for loops and using range in loops.
